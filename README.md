Chinese Financial Event Extraction Dataset


## Description

Chinese Financial Event Extraction Dataset (CFEED) is a financial-domain Chinese corpus regarding the major events in the announcements of listed companies. Each document in this corpus contains one or more event templates. This dataset is automatically generated by distant supervision method. We crawled the public announcements from [sohu.com](https://www.sohu.com/) and the event templates from [eastmoney.com](https://www.eastmoney.com/). Since the announcements are not in line with their corresponding event templates, we utilize distance supervision to align them. We assume that if the key role fillers in a template appear in an announcement, the announcement is describing the event in the template. In total, there are 3 types of events in CFEED:

* FREEZE: Equity Freezing refers to a compulsory measure adopted by the court to restrict the owner of equity to withdraw or transfer his own equity. The main purpose of such measures is to prevent the improper loss of equity returns.
* PLEDGE: Equity Pledging is that the shareholders of listed companies use their stocks (equity) as collateral to apply for loans from banks or provide a guarantee for loans from third parties.
* OW&UW: Equity overweighting\underweighting refers to the shareholder's increasing or reducing of their shares over the company.
